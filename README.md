BIOELECTRICITY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT (Final Year Project)

A demonstrative study of microbial fuel cell for the sustainable production of electricity.

Globally, there are staggering amounts of bio-waste, which could actually be considered as stored energy. This waste in liquid form could allow bacteria to convert it to electricity. A microbial fuel cell employs the use of these microbes to metabolise waste and generate ions. This won’t only reduce the environmental stress but also reduce the operational cost for various industries.
The microorganisms involved aerobically metabolise the hydrocarbons in the biological waste by means of the Kreb’s cycle, releasing ions into the chamber. The ions travel from the anode to the cathode chamber via a salt bridge, creating a flow of ions, or a current. This current travels through an external circuit and is thus a viable source of electric power. This creates an infinite loop of ion transfer, hence generating a stable electrical connection.

Project Objectives
•	To construct microbial fuel cells using cow dung, drain water, rice washing water, and slurry collected from biogas plant. 
•	To derive mathematical models to express voltage generated from the cells as a continuous function of time, so as to have an idea practically how long a cell remains functional. 
•	To evaluate the rate of change of the generated voltage with respect to time. 
•	To extrapolate how long the microbial fuel cells stay functioning. 
•	To observe whether a mixture of bio-waste does actually result in higher voltages.
